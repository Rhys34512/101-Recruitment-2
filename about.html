    <h4>Programming Skills:</h4>
	<p>Whilst quite limited, I have accumulated experience and knowledge in a variety of programming languages such as Visual C#, MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS, the latter of which has been of particular help during this subject. Additionally, I have enjoyed tinkering with more hardware-oriented electronic devices such as the Arduino, which utilises a subset of the C programming language.</p>
    <h4>Working experience:</h4>
	<p>Although I have yet to hold any formal working experience when it comes to programming, I have created multiple projects in my free time such as a text-based instant messaging application, file storage website and a browser-based user account system. After advancing my programming knowledge further, I endeavour to apply it in a professional workplace setting.</p>
    <h4>Interests:</h4>
	<p>Programming has undoubtedly been my primary hobby of interest, having been introduced to it in primary school through MIT's Scratch. However, I am also highly interested in music production and want to study music theory in my free time heading into the future. Additionally, I have had a long-standing passion for geography, global culture and flags.</p>
